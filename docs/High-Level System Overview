Handles secure login of university staff and faculty using university credentials.

Interfaces with the University Authentication Server to validate login attempts.

Ensures user data and credentials are encrypted and protected.

b. Ticket Management Module

Allows users to create, submit, and classify support tickets (network, hardware, software, account, etc.).

Provides status tracking, ticket prioritization (FIFO or admin override), and notification updates.

Supports searching tickets by ID, department, issue type, or status.

c. MIS Dashboard & Knowledge Base Module

Provides MIS staff with tools to assign, resolve, and update tickets.

Stores solutions into a searchable knowledge base for recurring problems.

Generates reports (ticket volume, resolution time, recurring issues) for decision-making and continuous improvement.

2. External Systems/Interfaces

University Authentication Server (API/Service) → Used for verifying staff/faculty credentials during login.

Notification Services (Email/SMS Gateway, In-App Messaging API) → Sends updates to users regarding ticket progress.

Database (SQL) → Stores tickets, user profiles, solutions, and reports data securely.

3. Data Flow Summary

Login & Authentication

Users (faculty/staff) submit login credentials → forwarded to the University Authentication Server.

The server validates credentials and returns an authentication result to the system.

Ticket Submission & Processing

Authenticated users create tickets with issue details.

The system classifies and queues tickets (FIFO by default, with admin override possible).

MIS Office views ticket queues via the dashboard, assigns them to staff, and updates resolutions.

Knowledge Base & Notifications

When a ticket is resolved, MIS staff record solutions in the knowledge base for future reference.

Users are notified (in-app, SMS, or email) about ticket status and resolution.

Reporting & Monitoring

The system compiles ticket data into reports for the MIS office.

Reports highlight trends (volume, resolution times, recurring problems) to support decision-making.
