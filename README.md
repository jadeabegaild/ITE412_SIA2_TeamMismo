Project title (tentative): MISMO: Management Information System for Monitoring Operation

• Short description of the system to be integrated: The University Technical Issue Reporting System is a web-based platform for managing technical issues for Mindoro State University (MinSU) staff and faculty. The system will be used by MinSU staff to submit requests and will be handled by MIS administrators and support staff. The system is a structured ticketing system that processes requests using a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle. Authorized MinSU staff and faculty access the system with their university credentials to submit tickets, which are classified by issue type such as network, hardware, or software.
